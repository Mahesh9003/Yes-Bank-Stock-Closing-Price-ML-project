Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction 
Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it is interesting to analyze how such incidents impact the stock prices of the company. This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Yes Bank stocks using various predictive models, including Elastic Net Regression.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains monthly stock prices of Yes Bank. It includes attributes such as the closing price, open price, highest price, and lowest price of the stock for each month. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the stock's historical performance.
# The objective of this project is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month. Discussion of Yes Bank Dataset will involve various steps such as:
1.  Loading the data into data frame 
2.  Understanding the Variables
3.	Cleaning the data 
4.	Extracting statistics from the dataset 
5.	Exploratory analysis and visualizations
6.	Train Test Split 
7.	Linear Regression 
8.	Lasso Regression 
9.	Ridge Regression 
10.	Elastic Net Regression 

# Results
After running the notebooks and training the models, we will obtain evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics can be used to assess the performance of the models and compare different approaches.
